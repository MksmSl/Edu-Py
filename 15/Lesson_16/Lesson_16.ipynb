    "While spreadsheets can be used to store and manage data, they are not the best choice for a number of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Limited functionality**: Spreadsheets are designed primarily for data entry and basic calculations, rather than complex data management. They lack the advanced features and functionality of dedicated database software.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Limited scalability**: Spreadsheets can become slow and unwieldy as the amount of data they contain grows. They are not designed to handle large amounts of data, and can quickly become difficult to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Limited security**: Spreadsheets are typically stored as files on a local or network drive, and can be accessed and edited by anyone with access to the file. They do not provide the same level of security and access control as a dedicated database management system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Limited data integrity**: Spreadsheets do not provide the same level of data integrity as a database management system. They can be easily corrupted or damaged, and data entered into a spreadsheet is not always validated or verified.\n"

    "## Alternative to store data\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using CSV, we can use relational database. Relational database is a software system designed to manage and organize large amounts of data, with a focus on maintaining data accuracy, consistency, and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to relation DBs, there are also NoSQL databases, which are designed to handle unstructured data, such as social media posts and multimedia files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Relational Database?\n",
    "\n",
    "A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into one or more tables, where each table consists of a set of rows and columns. Each column represents a specific data attribute, and each row represents a single record of data, with values for each of the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a relational database, tables can be related to one another based on common data attributes, such as ID. These relationships enable the database to efficiently store and retrieve data in a structured and consistent manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases use a query language, such as SQL (Structured Query Language), to retrieve and manipulate data. SQL is a powerful tool for working with relational databases, allowing users to select, filter, sort, and aggregate data across multiple tables."

The attributes of subjects are subject name. The attributes of student-subject relationships are student ID and subject ID.\n",
